In this project I built a system to manage appointments in a bank. The system has a login and registration section, 
and it allows users to create appointments, and to see the appointments they have created. 
The system also allows *manager* accounts to see the appointments created by other users and operate on them.
Besides the expected CRUD operations available, managers can *fulfil* appointments, which means that they can
mark them as completed, and leave a comment on them.

These managening accounts are assigned a department number, so they are restricted to see and operate on appointments
created by users that belong to the same department only.

Admin accounts are in charge of creating both types of accounts, and can see all the appointments created by all users, 
but cannot operate on them.

The system has validations in place to ensure that the data entered by the users is valid, and that the appointments
are created in the future, and not in the past. 
This validations are both applied on the client side as on the database side.
