This application was designed and developed under external requirements, 
and tuned up with what I thought was best for it.
I have to admit there are some things that could be done better,
but it works, and it's free.

There are some missing features that I would like to implement in the future,
but I don't have the time right now.

```python
def sort_pictures():
    """ Sorts the pictures in the input folder 
    into the output folder, according to
    the user configuration """
    config = load_config()
    in_folder_path = config['input_folder']
    source_items = os.listdir(config['input_folder'])
    if not config["single_file_folder"]:
        quantities = get_quantities(in_folder_path, source_items)
    else:
        quantities = None
    
    for item in source_items:
        input_file_path = in_folder_path + item
        metadata = get_file_details(input_file_path)
        
        output_folder = config['output_folder']
        year_folder = metadata['year']
        month_folder = format_month(config, metadata['month'])
        day_folder = metadata['day']
        if not config["single_file_folder"] and quantities[year_folder][metadata['month']][day_folder] < 2:
            day_folder = None
        secure_folder(output_folder, year_folder, month_folder, day_folder)
        move_opt = not config["keep_original"]
        move_file(move_opt, input_file_path, output_folder, year_folder, month_folder, day_folder, metadata['name'])
```
