This is not a game, but a playground for testing out ideas for a another RPG game.
It has been working not only as a prototype for a game I am working on, but as
a way to learn Godot and GDScript.
It's originally forked from a project by DevWorm.

## Skeleton chasing method

```GDScript
func detect_player(delta):
	player = Global.skeleton_player
	if player != null and alive:
		if !chasing:
			activate_exclamation_mark()
			if surprisable:
				done_being_surprised = false
				surprisable = false
		if done_being_surprised:	
			chasing = true
			speed = 30
			$AnimatedSprite2D.play("walk")
			destination = player.position - Vector2(0,-9)
			direction = (player.position - position).normalized()
			var range = player.position - position
			var direction: Vector2 = (destination - position).normalized()
			var movement: Vector2 = direction * speed * delta * 1.5
			if (range[1] > 0.2 or range[1] < -0.2) or (range[0] > 0.2 or range[0] < -0.2):
				position += movement
			set_direction(direction, destination)
			$AnimatedSprite2D.flip_h = direction.x < 0.5
	elif chasing and player == null:
		speed = ORIGINAL_SPEED
		chasing = false
		activate_question_mark()
	if !done_being_surprised:
		surprise()
```
