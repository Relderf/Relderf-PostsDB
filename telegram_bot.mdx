Due to its private nature, the code is not available. However, I can show you some of the functions that I used to make it work.
It's a brute force data scraper that checks the website quite often to see if there's a new chapter available. If so, it sends 
a message to a Telegram group. And during the lazy perios of time, it sleeps for a different amount of time depending on
how soon it will have to start checking again. It's tough, but it fulfills its purpose.

```python
def await_chapter(url, message, lastNumber):
    today = checkWeekday()
    print("Post-chapter verification begins.")
    while today not in ['wednesday', 'thursday']:
        notFound(today)
        sleep(DAY)
        today = checkWeekday()
    while today == 'wednesday':
        notFound(today)
        sleep(HOURS)
        today = checkWeekday()
    while today == 'thursday':
        print('[' + str(dt.datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S')) + '] Checking...')
        if get_chapter(url):
            send_message(message)
            print('Found ' + str(lastNumber) + ' at ' 
            + str(dt.datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S.')))
            break
        sleep(MINUTES)
        today = checkWeekday()
```
